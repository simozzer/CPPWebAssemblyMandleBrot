CPPWebAssemblyMandleBrot 

Just a basic play area for some basic stuff that I'm getting into whilst learning how to use C++ and Emscripten to produce WebAssembly files.

The code is bad, but it works, just needed somewhere to park my ideas whilst moving between PCs. This might become a bit of a non-specific playground.

To get this up and runnning I had to install a basic gcc/g++ stack, with autotools, cmake and git.

I basically followed instuctions here to get emsdk installed on openSuse Leap https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/


To build:
sh ./build.sh


To run:
sh ./serve.sh
